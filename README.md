# 🚲 Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study  

## 📌 About the Project  
This repository contains my capstone case study for the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**.  
The project explores **Cyclistic**, a bike-share company in Chicago, and answers the question:  

**"How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently, and how can we convert casual riders into members?"**

---

## 🗂 Project Overview  
- **Business Task:**  
  Understand usage patterns of casual vs. member riders and recommend strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.  

- **Data Source:**  
  Public historical bike trip data (Divvy, 2025) – covering Feb 2025 to Jul 2025.  

- **Tools Used:**  
  - Power BI → Data cleaning, processing, and visualizations  
  - Excel/CSV → Pre-processing  
  - GitHub → Documentation and project sharing  

---

## 📊 Key Findings  
- **Rider Split:** Casual (36.9%) | Members (63.1%)  
- **Bike Preference:** Electric bikes are more popular (64.2%) than classic bikes (35.8%).  
- **Ride Duration:** Casual riders average ~41 min (classic) vs. members ~12 min.  
- **Usage Patterns:**  
  - Casual → Weekends, mostly 4–6 PM (leisure focus)  
  - Members → Weekdays, 7–9 AM & 5–7 PM (commuting focus)  

---

## 💰 Break-Even Analysis  
- **Classic Bike (41 mins):** ~$8.79 per casual ride → Membership cheaper after ~2 rides/month.  
- **Electric Bike (14.56 mins):** ~$7.41 per casual ride → Membership cheaper after ~2 rides/month.  
- **Day Pass ($18.10):** Costs more than **1.5 months of membership ($11.99/month)**.  

✅ Insight: Most casual riders **overspend** compared to membership pricing.  

---

## ✅ Recommendations  
1. **Weekend-Only Membership**  
   - Introduce low-cost weekend plans (e.g., $75/year), then upsell to full membership.  

2. **Day Pass / Single Ride Upsell**  
   - Allow casuals to apply ride/day pass credit toward membership upgrades.  

3. **Targeted Marketing**  
   - Show in-app membership ads during **casual peak time (5–7 PM weekends)**.  
   - Send monthly spending reports comparing casual vs. member costs.  

4. **Member Perks**  
   - Free unlocks for members, loyalty points, partner discounts (cafes, gyms, events).  

5. **Behavioral Nudges**  
   - Highlight weekday commuting benefits.  
   - Run A/B tests on membership offers & track conversion rates.  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- A/B test new membership offers  
- Track conversion metrics casual → member  
- Expand dataset with seasonal analysis  
- Refine campaigns based on rider behavior
